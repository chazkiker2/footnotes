## Forward

> I guess it goes without saying that within these few pieces of art and literature, one is to find the same grace within a good shave after a drunken shower, saying “hello” to an old teacher in the high school parking lot, or watching an adolescent love dripping with nostalgia climb through the same windows of the art history classroom you once did when you were rooted within the context of your small, Illinois town.
>
> Never the mind of the deeper meaning, nor the illusion that poets, writers, or persuader with words can throw into a genuine audience. These words are for you. Exactly every single one. You know they are for you, and you only, and hopefully throughout the course of this specific, articulate, lazy, sun dried stanza forming nuclear Holocaust of mementoes do you too, the reader, find sustainability within.
>
> By the time you’re done, I advise a good Aperol spritzer, and a fine, warm shower. The glow of this over accentuated, locally sourced word extravaganza needs no other wash besides anything such as that. I apologize to, and I do also thank, everyone involved within these pages. I couldn’t have done it without you. All the best, and many more years,

## For Grace

## SMALL POIM

Sometimes I make certain phrases\
That contradict my previous thoughts.\
I am a walking ball\
Of twine, emitted to the state hospital for unnerving\
Self-satisfactory unwinding.\
I am the greatest mind\
Of my generation but no\
One seems to know it yet.

Maybe someone will say\
It in a documentary, or\
Late Night with Johnny Carson.\
I miss Johnny Carson\
I watch him every night\
Whilst I listen to Burl Ives\
And smoke the same cigarettes that\
The Gas station attendant told me her\
Grandpa smokes.

I felt weird after, but\
She meant it in good taste.\
I still remain the same,\
Above some, but below most others.\
I am but a man and myself.

## RADIO POIM

Would these Astro-Men\
Feel better burning their flesh in a failed test run,\
Or make the whole journey and back\
Only to burn up upon impact?<sup>1</sup>

I’ve stood in these New York Skyscrapers,\
Chiseling the grease off of frying pits.\
I felt the humorous, belly aching guilt\
Of watching men break their legs and getting shot behind a stable.

Rather than laugh, I was amazed by the disc jockey’s\
Two-sided persona; suckling out sour milk and yet,\
Still spitting it back out to thousands.

As their empire fell in their hands,\
They were left for the barbarians\
Knocking at their door:

*“We’re not savages,\
but we’re gutting you till there’s nothing left but your\
hides.”*

---

<sup>1</sup> I fell asleep in an office,\
watching a man lose his job and frantically\
edit final ads at his radio station.\
I met the man who bought their company for dinner\
That very night. He tipped the waiter a 20\
He had air dropped a microphone during his speech\
At the seminar the day before.

## LAURENS POIM

Whoever lets the feather That fly’s by\
Be a symbol of what it really means\
(Literally connection, power and freedom)\
Are truly not. For it to be true,\
There would be no symbol\
No attribute to one’s life, but only\
No such form at all. It would just *be*.

. . .

I watched you vomit up the ice cream\
Back into its cup. you told me it was okay,\
And I understood, but yelled at you for\
Your damn political discretions.\
I called you an *insensitive hypocrite*.

By the time it was over\
What you had finished had already come back up.\
After, I finally understood how precious being alone is\
And how it’s better after long connection\
To sit and digest it, rather than always have\
The constant loom ahead that not\
one person was there in the first place.

## LOVE POIM

I took your laugh, and everything else I love about you.\
I noticed it last night, that my skin stretched a bit\
differently\
In the wake of comfortability. The wide gap between\
your lips,\
Is almost a surprise, but I make your back pulsate with a\
silent laugh.<sup>1</sup>

No sound comes out, but the body language says it all.

I hope to God, I don’t take your smile-\
Trademark it and sue me; teach me a lesson, like I want\
you to.\
Tell me you don’t want me to turn out like you,\
It’ll just make me want to more.

I heard you sing one night, I hadn’t before.\
It wasn’t very good, but isn’t that what’s love supposed\
to be about?\
I imagine grabbing your hips from a backseat of some\
car,\
And fill in the skin missing around your ribs. We Mold.<sup>2</sup>

I couldn’t look at you. I was caved in by another’s leg.\
But I grew balls and did. You weren’t looking.

Figured.<sup>3</sup>

---

<sup>1</sup> Half empty, I remember how we laid\
In your bunk bed blowing smoke between our lips, almost kissing.

<sup>2</sup> Half full, I am dissapointed,\
But overall, fully aware you were never\
Going to come back to Tennessee.\
I guess we'll always have that time\
I pissed behind your garage because your\
Mom wouldn't let me go in the house.

<sup>3</sup> Damn.

## PRAYER POIM

I always return to you on accident.\
It may be a happy one, but nonetheless\
I am forgetful.\
You come creeping in\
With quiet reservation, sitting on the leather\
Couch. I can hear you grunt as you sit.

Old man

There are drunk youths on the\
Slimy rocks of olde swimming holes,\
New faces, and bold.\
I believe I am owed a rebirth.\
& to you, I offer a cleanse\
& a good brush of the teeth.

I am always myself\
Regardless of past and present.\
I am a sheep in a wolf’s clothes, automatically.\
I’ll hoof you, for I’m a virgin victim\
Of every atrocity ever.\
Yet, I wonder if I’ve ever learned anything?

## MARY POIM

Were it not for the clicking of boot heels,\
Nor your overalls covered in grease,\
With your anecdotes about your Grandfather\
And how much he loved Patsy Cline,\
Well, I’d have to say I was mistaken\
Assuming the rolling Santa Barbra hills\
Over the beach, would’ve been my home.

No, it be by the will of God, that thou\
Stretched me back across the land\
I was trying to escape, running away\
Like a child does, but only just around the corner.\
Our house would be built around faith and unity.\
Intellectual talks over homemade goods and\
neighboring farmers with their own tales of American glory.<sup>1</sup>

What sweet tea has me feeling so dizzy\
that I yearn for the Tennessean lifelong fulfillment\
Of raising my children, we bare from your sunlit skin\
on a peaceful sunset, in the faith and resonance of holiness.

My god, my God, you come with conflicting\
Reformation and yet I still remain restrained and reborn\
every time I come looking for you, be it by the\
willingness of her curly bangs, or the history you’ve gifted my family.

I am reserved at the table, waiting for you to take a seat,\
but then only realizing it is you who is still waiting for me\
in a different place, telling the waiter\
*“He’ll be here soon; he’s never stood me up before!”*

---

<sup>1</sup> I still whistle, idly by, banking off the idea\
That I will somehow grasp the edge of a pillowcase\
In sheer certainty that my internal caucus\
Of reluctant self-satisfaction will attract some sort of pleasure\
between the hills we touched lips at.

## MILWAUKEE POIM (VOL. I)

Sometimes I find myself drifted off\
from the past years, and it only takes\
some familiar highway\
Or local landmark for it to trigger\
That a single year\
Or years *-plural* have passed.

What is going to happen\
the next time I’m on the stretch\
Of highway\
Just getting out of Milwaukee?

Will you be in the passenger seat\
just thinking &\
Flipping through *“Good Homes and Gardens”*\
For new silver and china?\
The ones that mother got us\
for our first apartment

Are statue of liberty green\
From the copper we forgot to wash properly.\
Will the righteous naysayers of our love\
Be friends

We have drinks with in the city and we talk\
About day jobs\
And call it in early\
So the babysitter can get home?\
*“She does have a midterm to study for you know.”*\
You say as you turn the next page.

By now, so many people have gone\
And I don’t know where they went\
They seemed to have just drifted by\
Like time did and I realized I had bought a home for us.

## RED GOLD POIM (VOL. II)

I was nervous.\
Not because of what she was *giving* me,\
But because her presence loomed.

I’m paralyzed.\
Not because of her *beauty*, her *intelligence*, or her *creativity*,\
But because of the future <sup>1</sup>

I’m unwilling\
To sacrifice the little amount I have left\
Of her bug faced squatting methods.

I have my own damn realizations to make,\
Not some pre-nuptial communist rampage\
While our kid* eats the fat off capitalist pork chops.\
........ * You thought of having one, that one time.

The *fuck* were we going to put it, the empty guest house above the garage?

I am aware.\
Not of the unfulfilling nature of us,\
But of the stain you promised to clean in the sheet.

I was hoping.\
Not for another reach around to let you get off,\
But of some reimbursement for the dry cleaners.

I lay awake in somber slumber slopping up\
Soup of the surreal serenity you stuck in my\
Knapsack while I slept in your creaky bedroom.\
........ * You thought we would move in together.

Where were we going to go, southern Illinois?

I can hear the checkout lady call your name to clean the\
spill in Aisle 7.

---

<sup>1</sup> I then remembered how she used to come behind me\
as I stood to piss over the toilet, and she'd take aim.\
She was enthralled by how it all worked.\
Everything makes more sense now.

## NATES POIM

For you Nathan,

the hills that roll over on my horizon\
Carry your youth that was swept away so quickly.

Even if closeness never defined us,\
Even if others say they love you more,

I will never forget Halloween night ghost stories\
Or Helping me find batteries at Best Buy.

Or the glowing stamina you were\
Surrounded in.

I will try, but never match\
The life and love others have gained\
At your genuine expense.

The city skyline burns for you tonight,\
As your spirit sinks in the last cloud

That floats beside my favorite building\
Reflecting God’s light unto the world.

## SMALL POIMS

### I

I couldn’t tell if I voluntarily grabbed the tip of my pillowcase, or if the infant complex\
Kicked in, and like a child does, I grabbed\
Onto whatever I could find, Unconsciously,

Just so that I Had something to hold onto\
And explore. Are we really that far off\
As we were? The hallway is still on fire\
But there’s nothing we’ve really done about\
it.

### II

At last, through all the troubles,\
He stood behind her with the composure\
Of a confident 20’s Rockefeller with his\
First wife. Proper, and straightforward.

No Marlboro posters in old bar bathrooms\
No concrete roadside dividing lines\
Could be as predictable as\
Their willingness to stay together.

### III

Passionately, I get stoned with strangers\
On 16th avenue just for helluv it.\
And amongst all the Christian studios\
I breeze past and smell latkes in-between\
buildings

In refuge, we seek our own traditions\
In the dark amongst the many others.\
But outwardly, we are all fathers with our\
daughters

And they harass drunk teenagers with their\
trikes.

### IV

I will stand in your hallway and make\
believe\
Friendship with you and your house pets,\
Only when my days are numbered, and\
catalogued\
By the cups of tea, I drink halfway till it’s\
cold.

My bare feet will stick to your shag carpet,\
and\
you will remember; you will hear me\
haunt your house: *“I’m going to give you\
good memories\
and die on you,

Just for the sake of easing my death onto\
others.”*

## EULOGY (RECYCLED IN IV. PARTS)

### I | RE: E

It’s strange! I can hear your voice whenever\
I come to think of you, or when I’m in New York,\
or at least thinking about it. It was just last year I was\
there,\
but you weren’t yet.

And now that you are there and I’m not,\
I want to believe we were in the same place\
At the right time.

Nonetheless, we will find ourselves in that city someday\
I’m sure of it! We will be laughing, walking,\
Squawking like pigeons talking of our own rats in our\
own sewers.\
We will be royalty, laughing louder;

Howling more than the others that surround the busy\
streets.

We may pass the Brooklyn bridge and lookout,\
Far into the water and see our 14-year-old reflections.\
We will laugh at my bowties and slicked back hairspray\
helmets\
I used to put on before school.

We can cry at the times we cried together!\
So many -too many times we have, but it was\
Just who we were!

We can love at the times we loved each other!\
So many -maybe never enough times we did,\
but it was just who we were. We will hold hands when I\
walk you back\
To your apartment, but maybe some Gin on the way\
over?

I can come up and meet your cats!

Oh, the pears are ripe? Let me have some. The Newest\
issue?\
Let me read it. An old recipe? It’s worth a shot.\
Before long it’s dusk and I have to let go.\
Have we been holding hands the whole time?

When I do let go like so many -maybe too many\
times, I’ll stumble down the gutters\
And kick the leaves.

I wanted another 45-minute goodbye.\
It’s hard to let go of these imaginary visits and real\
memories of you.\
The balcony I imagine hanging over the street\
Carries you and your cat, perched on a white couch.

*“Until next time! Bring your own Gin!”*

### II | RE: John Jr

These boxing lessons in the kitchen coup\
Reminds me of a brother I still have\
Yet don’t remember. Especially when it comes to fair\
fights\
And life lessons. (Other than saying school is for\
suckers)

To you, I must be what you are to my father.\
Aunty, your mother cooks up\
The smoke that smells like holiday family dinners.\
A Cousin remains the coffee drinker

at the end of the table.

I cock back to wind another sucker punch,\
But you warn me the right person\
will see me push forward by seeing me\
push back first, and will cut me before I even know

I have a shot in the first place.

“Hey kid, with that hit you’re bound to knock\
Someone out.” *Who says I haven’t already?*\
We both swallowed that lie, and ate hot sandwiches,\
Then drank a few and rapped to each other about new\
television.

### III | RE: B

I put all my energy and focus into finding romantic\
connections
and pursuing them at my own cost, according to Hannah.\
But over the Hillside cemeteries,\
Quakes happened back and forth.

You grabbed my chest and sank me down to talk:\
“No one’s gonna put up with your shit\
when no one knows your name”.\
*I just want a girlfriend that can eat Chinese food.*

Crab Rangoon, Order of egg rolls\
Pork fried rice, vegetable Egg foo young\
Beef lo main. We watch Vietnam Documentaries,\
And I say I want one myself.

*“Documentaries make me question\
my own mortality”*

Where’s mine and how do I get one?

*“Leave it alone for now,\
It comes only when least expected.”*

### IV | RE: Everyone I’ve ever loved

At last, beyond my command, my heart reached out\
And you willfully placed it back. Not only did you hit\
the mark
Not only did you satisfy, but you added what was\
needed\
And parted what was wanted.

Our rosy cheeks, plump and dimpled, with nose nipped\
from Milwaukee air, shine against the leaves that brown\
around\
As we converse and kick them in gutters;\
We warm up under lamp posts.

Will you get mad at me when I wash out the coffee\
grounds\
in the sink, and you complain that you just cleaned it?\
Will you come home from work and I had to cook\
dinner\
instead of you?

Will we have parties with our college friends and\
talk, drink, smoke, take pictures and age like all family\
members\
do in photo albums? We’ll we be sitting six feet across\
each other\
Toes almost touching, reading our paper magazines.

Do I feel proud to call you my wife? My spouse?\
No, not just a lover anymore, but someone who can fall\
asleep\
on my shoulder when we take the subway home\
From the market and the steam from the homemade\
pasta tickles my nose.

Let the dog back in, it’s cold. Try this. Too cheesy?\
*Set the table.* I’ll reply yes without hesitation\
Knowing I can cook supper for two or four\
Or how many. Just happy I can do it all for you.
